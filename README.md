===========

Drawing lines over images and captured video

Wanting to get back into some *creative coding* i harkened to [days of yore](http://www.flickr.com/photos/staydecent/2313458332/in/photostream) and recreated a [Processing](www.processing.org) concept in WebGL with [Three.js](threejs.org).

The basic concept is there, next step is capturing webcam data and rendering the lines over that.

Oh yeah, the line vertices' z-axis responds to an images rgb-pixel data.

### Get this running
